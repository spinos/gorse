 *  Monopodial Branching 
 *
 *  in which the growth of the main axis continues throughout a plantâ€™s life, as do the 
 *  second-order and third-order branches developing on the main axis. 
 *  The growth of the main axis may cease temporarily under unfavorable conditions, 
 *  for example, during the winter. Monopodial branching is characteristic of 
 *  many seed plants (spruce, oak, lily of the valley), green algae, fungi, 
 *  and leafy mosses.
